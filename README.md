## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18 or higher recommended)
- Make (usually pre-installed on Linux and macOS)

### Build the Project

```sh
make build
```
This will compile the project and create the executable binary.

### Run the Project

make run
```
This will start the server. By default, it runs on port 8080.

### Run Tests

```sh
make test
```
This will execute all tests in the project.

### Clean Build Artifacts

```sh
make clean
```
This will remove the compiled binary.
